# Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) – MDR Example

This document explains how to apply the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) to an **Electrosurgical Unit (ESU)**. Designed for biomedical engineers and regulatory learners.

---

##  1. Device Description

An **Electrosurgical Unit (ESU)** delivers high-frequency electrical current to cut, coagulate, desiccate, or fulgurate biological tissue during surgical procedures.

Modes:
- **Cutting**
- **Coagulation**
- **Blend (cut + coag)**
- **Bipolar or monopolar operation**

Components:
- Generator
- Active electrode (pencil or probe)
- Return electrode (neutral pad)
- Footswitch
- Optional smoke evacuator

---

##  2. MDR Classification

According to **MDR Annex VIII, Rule 9**:

> **“All active therapeutic devices intended to administer energy to the human body are at least Class IIb.”**

Therefore:
- **Electrosurgical units = Class IIb**

Due to their **direct application of electrical energy** for tissue alteration and surgical intervention.

---

##  3. Technical Documentation (Annex II)

Must include:

- System architecture and electrical block diagram
- Output modes and frequency/power settings
- Safety mechanisms (e.g. REM – Return Electrode Monitoring)
- Alarms (circuit failure, pad detachment, overheating)
- Output waveform data and test results
- Risk analysis (ISO 14971)
- EMC testing (IEC 60601-1-2)
- Electrical safety and leakage (IEC 60601-1)
- Performance standards (IEC 60601-2-2)
- Instructions for sterilization (if reusable accessories)

---

##  4. Clinical Evaluation (Annex XIV)

Must include:

- Evidence of safety and effectiveness in cutting/coagulation
- Thermal injury risk analysis
- Evaluation of patient burns from pad misplacement
- Equivalence to marketed devices
- Usability assessment in OR environment

---

##  5. Labeling & IFU (Annex I)

Include:

- CE mark and UDI
- Output ranges and modes clearly listed
- Graphical icons for mode switching
- Instructions for pad placement and precautions
- Compatible accessories list (pencils, pads, cords)
- Cleaning and sterilization guide
- Thermal safety warnings

---

##  6. CE Marking

- Requires **Notified Body** review  
- Conformity via **Annex IX** (Full QMS audit) or **Annex XI**
- Declaration of Conformity aligned with MDR Annex IV
- QMS certified to **ISO 13485**

---

##  7. Post-Market Surveillance

Must include:

- Tracking of patient burn incidents or device malfunctions
- Monitoring of alarm failures or unsafe outputs
- Maintenance records and software logs (if applicable)
- Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR)

---

##  8. Economic Operators

Define and document roles for:

- Manufacturer
- Authorized Representative (non-EU)
- Importer and distributor
- Technical support / service team

All must comply with MDR Articles 11–16.

---

##  9. Relevant Standards

- **IEC 60601-1** – Electrical safety  
- **IEC 60601-1-2** – EMC  
- **IEC 60601-2-2** – Particular standard for ESUs  
- **ISO 14971** – Risk management  
- **ISO 10993** – Biocompatibility (for accessories)  
- **IEC 62366** – Usability engineering  
- **IEC 62304** – Software lifecycle (if applicable)
