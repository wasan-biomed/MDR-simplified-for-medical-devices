# Blood Pressure Monitor – MDR Example

This document explains how to apply the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) to a **blood pressure monitor** (manual or digital). It serves as a simplified, real-world example for biomedical engineers and students.

---

##  1. Device Description

A blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer) is a device used to measure a patient's arterial blood pressure. It can be:
- **Manual** (aneroid)
- **Digital** (automatic)

Used in hospitals, clinics, and homes for diagnosing or monitoring hypertension.

---

##  2. MDR Classification

According to MDR Annex VIII, Rule 10:

> **"Devices intended for monitoring of vital physiological parameters are Class IIa."**

So, most blood pressure monitors are:
- **Class IIa**  
(Because they monitor vital signs and may influence treatment decisions)

---

##  3. Technical Documentation (Annex II)

You must prepare a **technical file** including:
- Device description
- Design drawings and specifications
- Materials used (cuff, tubing, sensors)
- Manufacturing process
- Risk analysis (ISO 14971-based)
- Test reports (safety, accuracy, durability)
- Software (for digital models)
- Sterility information (if applicable)

---

##  4. Clinical Evaluation (Annex XIV)

Demonstrate that the device performs safely and effectively. This includes:
- Clinical data from literature or trials
- Performance comparison with existing devices
- Post-market data (if available)

---

##  5. Labeling & IFU (Annex I)

Make sure the device label and Instructions For Use (IFU) include:
- CE mark
- UDI (Unique Device Identifier)
- Manufacturer name & address
- Expiration date, serial number
- Symbols explained
- Clear safety warnings and operating instructions

---

##  6. CE Marking

To place the **CE mark**:
- Apply conformity assessment procedure (typically via Notified Body for Class IIa)
- Complete the Declaration of Conformity
- Maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) – usually ISO 13485

---

##  7. Post-Market Surveillance

After placing the product on the market, monitor:
- Complaints and adverse events
- Product recalls or field safety notices
- Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR)

You must have a **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) plan** and update your risk file continuously.

---

##  8. Economic Operators (MDR Articles 11-16)

Ensure you define roles clearly:
- **Manufacturer**
- **Authorized Representative** (if outside EU)
- **Importer**
- **Distributor**

Each operator has specific MDR obligations.
