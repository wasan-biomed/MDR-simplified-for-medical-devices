# Pulse Oximeter – MDR Example

This document explains how to apply the **European Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745)** to a **pulse oximeter**.  
It is written for biomedical engineers and students.

---

## 1. Device Description

A **pulse oximeter** is a non-invasive device that estimates blood oxygen saturation (**SpO₂**) and pulse rate by measuring the absorption of light through a patient's fingertip, toe, or earlobe.

**Types of pulse oximeters:**
- Finger-tip oximeters (home use)
- Handheld oximeters (clinical)
- Integrated in patient monitors

---

## 2. MDR Classification

According to **MDR Annex VIII, Rule 10**:

> *“Devices intended for monitoring of vital physiological parameters are Class IIa.”*

✅ Therefore:  
**Pulse oximeters = Class IIa**  
Because they monitor SpO₂, which can influence treatment decisions.

## 3. Technical Documentation (Annex II)

Must include:

- System architecture and flow diagram  
- Sensor technology (light wavelengths, photodiodes)  
- Signal acquisition and processing logic  
- Accuracy validation (SpO₂ and pulse)  
- Risk analysis (ISO 14971)  
- Biocompatibility data (ISO 10993)  
- Power source and battery safety  
- EMC and electrical safety tests (IEC 60601-1, -1-2)  
- Software documentation (if digital/with display)

---

## 4. Clinical Evaluation (Annex XIV)

Must demonstrate:

- Accuracy and repeatability across different patient types  
- Comparison with arterial blood gas (ABG) or clinical gold standards  
- Tolerance under low perfusion and motion artifacts  
- Performance validation in hypoxic ranges

---

## 5. Labeling & IFU (Annex I)

Include:

- CE mark and UDI  
- Measurement site and usage instructions  
- Contraindications and warnings (e.g., nail polish, cold extremities)  
- Expected accuracy range (e.g. ±2%)  
- Cleaning and storage guidance  
- Battery and power warnings (if applicable)

---

## 6. CE Marking

- Requires **Notified Body** involvement (Class IIa)  
- Conformity assessment: **Annex IX** or **Annex XI**  
- Must have ISO 13485 QMS certification  
- Declaration of Conformity referencing MDR

---

## 7. Post-Market Surveillance

Establish a PMS system to:

- Track real-world accuracy complaints  
- Monitor false readings or device errors  
- Submit Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR)  
- Report serious incidents under MDR Article 87

---

## 8. Economic Operators

Define roles for:

- Manufacturer  
- Authorized Representative (if non-EU)  
- Importer / Distributor  
- Technical service (if applicable)  

Each actor must comply with MDR Articles 11–16.

---

## 9. Relevant Standards

- **ISO 80601-2-61** – Particular standard for pulse oximeters  
- **IEC 60601-1** – Electrical safety  
- **IEC 60601-1-2** – EMC  
- **ISO 14971** – Risk management  
- **IEC 62366** – Usability engineering  
- **ISO 10993** – Biocompatibility  
- **IEC 62304** – Software lifecycle
