# Pulse Oximeter – MDR Example

This document explains how to apply the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) to a **pulse oximeter**. It is written for biomedical engineers and students.

---

##  1. Device Description

A **pulse oximeter** is a non-invasive device that estimates blood oxygen saturation (**SpO₂**) and pulse rate by measuring the absorption of light through a patient's fingertip, toe, or earlobe.

Types:
- Finger-tip oximeters (home use)
- Handheld oximeters (clinical)
- Integrated in patient monitors

---

##  2. MDR Classification

According to **MDR Annex VIII, Rule 10**:

> **“Devices intended for monitoring of vital physiological parameters are Class IIa.”**

Therefore:
- **Pulse oximeters = Class IIa**  
Because they monitor SpO₂, which can influence treatment decisions.

---

##  3. Technical Documentation (Annex II)

Must include:

- System architecture and flow diagram
- Sensor technology (light wavelengths, photodiodes)
- Signal acquisition and processing logic
- Accuracy validation (SpO₂ and pulse)
- Risk analysis (ISO 14971)
- Biocompatibility data (ISO 10993)
- Power source and battery safety
- EMC and electrical safety tests (IEC 60601-1, -1-2)
- Software documentation (if digital/with display)

---

##  4. Clinical Evaluation (Annex XIV)

Must demonstrate:

- Accuracy and repeatability across different patient types
- Comparison with arterial blood gas (ABG) or clinical gold standards
- Tolerance under low perfusion and motion artifacts
- Performance validation in hypoxic ranges

---

##  5. Labeling & IFU (Annex I)

Include:

- CE mark and UDI
- Measurement site and usage instructions
- Contraindications and warnings (e.g., nail polish, cold extremities)
- Expected accuracy range (e.g. ±2%)
- Cleaning and storage guidance
- Battery and power warnings (if applicable)

---

##  6. CE Marking

- Requires **Notified Body** involvement (Class IIa)
- Conformity assessment: **Annex IX** or **Annex XI**
- Must have ISO 13485 QMS certification
- Declaration of Conformity referencing MDR

---

##  7. Post-Market Surveillance

Establish a PMS system to:

- Track real-world accuracy complaints
- Monitor false readings or device errors
- Submit Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR)
- Report serious incidents under MDR Article 87

---

##  8. Economic Operators

Define roles for:

- Manufacturer
- Authorized Representative (if non-EU)
- Importer / Distributor
- Technical service (if applicable)

Each actor must comply with MDR Articles 11–16.

---

## ⚠ 9. Relevant Standards

- **ISO 80601-2-61** – Particular standard for pulse oximeters
- **IEC 60601-1** – Electrical safety
- **IEC 60601-1-2** – EMC
- **ISO 14971** – Risk management
- **IEC 62366** – Usability engineering
- **ISO 10993** – Biocompatibility
- **IEC 62304** – Software lifecycle
