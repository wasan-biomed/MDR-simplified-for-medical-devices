# Surgical Suction – MDR Example

This document explains how to apply the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) to a **surgical suction device**. It is intended for biomedical engineers and regulatory learners.

---

##  1. Device Description

A **surgical suction device** is an electrically powered system that removes blood, fluids, pus, or debris from the surgical field or airway to maintain a clear view and reduce infection risk.

Types:
- Portable suction units
- Wall-mounted systems
- High-vacuum/low-vacuum systems
- Yankauer, tubing, canisters

---

##  2. MDR Classification

Under **MDR Annex VIII, Rule 9 & Rule 11**:

> **“All active therapeutic devices intended to administer or remove body substances are Class IIa.”**

So:
- **Surgical suction devices = Class IIa**

Because they remove fluids from the body and may impact patient safety during procedures.

---

##  3. Technical Documentation (Annex II)

Must include:

- System description and diagram
- Suction pump specs: flow rate, pressure range
- Tubing and canister material details (biocompatibility)
- Filter system specs (HEPA, bacterial)
- Battery backup (if mobile)
- Risk management file (ISO 14971)
- Electrical safety (IEC 60601-1)
- EMC testing (IEC 60601-1-2)
- Noise level data
- Cleaning and disinfection compatibility

---

##  4. Clinical Evaluation (Annex XIV)

Must demonstrate:

- Reliable suction performance
- Flow rate under different loads
- Effectiveness of filter systems
- Fail-safe operation during surgeries
- Comparisons with predicate devices

---

##  5. Labeling & IFU (Annex I)

Include:

- CE marking and UDI
- Flow/pressure specs and limits
- Instructions for tubing and filter replacement
- Disinfection and sterilization guide
- Battery status indicators
- Alarm or alert indicators (if present)
- Noise emission level (optional)

---

##  6. CE Marking

- Requires **Notified Body** assessment (Class IIa)
- Follow conformity assessment per Annex IX or XI
- Maintain certified QMS (ISO 13485)
- Complete Declaration of Conformity referencing MDR

---

##  7. Post-Market Surveillance

Implement a PMS system to:

- Track device failures, suction issues
- Monitor user feedback on power/battery reliability
- Report serious incidents (MDR Article 87)
- Submit PSUR (Periodic Safety Update Report)

---

##  8. Economic Operators

Define roles for:

- Manufacturer
- Authorized Representative (if non-EU)
- Importer / Distributor
- Service technician/partner (if applicable)

Each must meet MDR Articles 11–16 responsibilities.

---

## ⚠️ 9. Relevant Standards

- **IEC 60601-1** – General electrical safety
- **IEC 60601-1-2** – EMC
- **ISO 10079-1** – Suction devices for hospital use
- **ISO 14971** – Risk management
- **ISO 10993** – Biocompatibility
- **IEC 62366** – Usability engineering
