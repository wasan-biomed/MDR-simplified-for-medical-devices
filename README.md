# MDR for Medical Devices – Simplified Guide

This repository explains the **European Medical Device Regulation (MDR)** in a **clear and simple way**, using **real examples of medical devices**. It is made for **biomedical engineers, students, and anyone working with medical devices** who wants to understand the essential MDR steps.

---

## 📌 What is MDR?

MDR (Medical Device Regulation – EU 2017/745) is the **European law that controls the safety, quality, and performance of medical devices** before and after they are sold in the EU.

If you want to market a device like a **blood pressure monitor**, **ECG**, or **infusion pump** in Europe, you must follow MDR requirements.

---

## 🔍 Key MDR Requirements (Overview)

1. **Device classification** (Class I, IIa, IIb, III)
2. **Technical documentation** (design, materials, safety)
3. **Risk analysis and clinical evaluation**
4. **CE marking** (must comply with MDR Annexes)
5. **Post-market surveillance** (monitor safety after sale)
6. **UDI** (Unique Device Identification system)

---

## ✅ Example: Blood Pressure Monitor

To sell a digital or manual BP monitor in the EU:

- **Classify** it (usually Class IIa)
- **Prepare** a technical file (with specs, safety data)
- **Provide** clinical evaluation or performance tests
- **Label** the device properly (with CE mark, UDI)
- **Monitor** the device for post-market incidents
